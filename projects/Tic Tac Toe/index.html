                        <p>Tic-tac-toe is also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. It is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
                            The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. </p><br>

            <p> It is simple game build using tkinter python package. The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
                Both Tk and tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows systems.

                            <h3> Tkinter Module : </h3>
                            <p>
                                Most of the time, tkinter is all you really need, but a number of additional modules are available as well.
                                The Tk interface is located in a binary module named _tkinter.
                                This module contains the low-level interface to Tk, and should never be used directly by application programmers.
                                It is usually a shared library (or DLL), but might in some cases be statically linked with the Python interpreter.

                                In addition to the Tk interface module, tkinter includes a number of Python modules, tkinter.
                                constants being one of the most important. Importing tkinter will automatically import tkinter.

                            <h3>Installing Tkinter:</h3>
                            <p> To use Tkinter all you need is a simple import statement:</p>
                            <h6> import tkinter</h6>
                            <p> or </p>
                            <h6> from tkinter import *</h6><hr>
                             <h3> Working :</h3>
                                    <p> It is coded in a simple python and  mainly uses function defining concept of python.
                                        When ' X player ' plays a move background turns to white and when ' O player ' plays a move background turn to black.
                                        When player wins,  that particular row or column or diagonal becomes red indicating the winner of game.
                                    </p><hr>
